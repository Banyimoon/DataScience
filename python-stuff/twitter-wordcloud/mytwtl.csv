58,2015-19-01 16:17:24,@rasbt Final solution: having 2 positive test results will increase the chance of having the disease 90 folds as expected intuitively!

60,2015-19-01 15:11:41,@rasbt We want P(ill|++)? Which according to #bayesian is P(++|ill)*P(ill)/P(++) and I can use binomial distribution with 2 Bernoulli trials
61,2015-19-01 14:51:15,"@rasbt yeah! Assuming that the test is iid, so basically you repeat the test twice and intuitively I would expect to get more confident"
62,2015-19-01 14:41:30,@rasbt we have a prior P(ill) and likelihood P(+|ill) and P(+|healthy)! Now we want posterior probability P(ill|++)
